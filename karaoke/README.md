Read Me for Lab 4 - Karaoke

1. I believe I have correctly implemented everything. The only thing that seems like it could be fixed is the number of lines of code in my updateText function. I'm pretty sure this is the only way to print all these lyrics (I wanted short segments, not whole lines to appear at one time), however it would be nice to have less if statements. 

2. I did not collaborate with anybody on this assignment.

3. This took me a surprisingly long time to complete. I was messing with addEventListener methods for a while, plus the syntax of javascript confused me a little bit. I'm not used to how lenient it is - many times I wasn't sure if I was typing a syntax error, or if my code simply didn't work. The javascript console helped me a little bit on this.
