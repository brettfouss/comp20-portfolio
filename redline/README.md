Read Me for Lab 5 - Redline
Brett Fouss

1. Everything is correctly implemented in terms of using the google maps API. The map renders neatly on the screen, and centers on Boston. The only problem is that the JSON will not work, but I did not implement it anyways.

2. I did not collaborate with anybody on this assignment.

3. This didn't take me that long to complete. It was hard to get the map to render for a while - I had to look at a lot of examples and adjust my javascript to match them. However, it seems there are many ways to get the map to render. This is pretty cool to me.

Why I cannot recieve live updates from the MBTA...

The same origin policy prevents me from requesting real time data using XMLHttpRequest. As so, it is both a security measure and a constraint. My code is requesting data (through XMLHttpRequest) from the domain "mbta," which the same origin policy disallows. There are some workarounds to this (proxies, JSONP), but we haven't learned those yet.
